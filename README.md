# civil-enforcement-prototype
Citizen facing application prototype for Civil Enforcement

This is a CET prototyping project based on the GOV.UK prototyping kit. Anyone can help to improve it, but be sure to read our contributing guidelines before you do.

About the prototype kit
The prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

Read the project principles.

Security
If you publish your prototypes online, they must be protected by a username and password. This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like GOV.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
