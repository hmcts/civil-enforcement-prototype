<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Apply for the court to collect payment</h3>

<p>If your money claim is still unpaid you can ask the court to collect payment for you, known as enforcing a judgment.</p>

<p>Types of enforcement include asking the court to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>send a bailiff to their home or business</li>
    <li>take money from their wages</li>
    <li>freeze money in their bank account</li>
    <li>put a charging order on property they own</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Court fees</h3>

<p>You will need to pay a court fee each time you ask the court to use enforcement. For example, if the court cannot get money from their wages, you will need to pay another fee to send a bailiff. The court fee you pay is then added to the total debt owed to you. If the court can get your money back the money repaid to you will also include the court fees you have paid.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that the court will be able get your money back. If the court cannot collect payment you will be responsible for all enforcement fees.</p>
