1,CCJ application email,notifications-claimant,email1,email,"Why 14 days? Why not 7 days? Why is it dragged out? The guy has done wrong. I want things moving. Let’s get these things cleared quicker. Yes it’s all familiar. I’d love to know if Andrew Smith has other CCJs, if he has other court cases. It would affect whether I would enforce him or not. I would not pursue if I knew he had other CCJs. Like a reference, credit reference. How many jobs they’re doing (specific to builders). Expectation? You would put details of Andrew Smith in.","That’s very clear. Essentially they are saying if you haven’t heard I can get a CCJ. He’s got two reasons to do it (credit rating + force of the law). Then enforcement comes after if he doesn’t pay. Would click on the handy link, I would have lost my patience. All attempts to contact him would have failed but would have one lost go - phone number","If AS hasn’t paid, you can now get a CCJ against him. Some background on the CCJ. It’s very clear. I’d be happy to see this message rather than ‘we’re waiting…’ at least the wheels are working, process is happening.","It’s telling me they have received the claim, it’s reassuring to know that the Court has understood your claim and that the process is happening. If he doesn’t pay, in that time frame the CCJ will be taken out on him. If he still doesn’t pay - bailiffs.",I’m assuming that Mr Green was told about the 14 days. People are sometimes more familiar with CCJ than with what is stands for. RUMC - never heard of that phrase before. Interesting. It’s not replicated on page (2).,"Participants were clear what is going on at this point, and reassured the process was apparently moving forward",,
2,Case dashboard,claimant-dashboard,case,dashboard,Claim number...status...you’re wanting to enforce the CCJ. I would click request.,"It’s getting to the legal side of it. Download a claim? Download what I’ve already submitted, for my own reference? He has not responded so therefore I can request a CCJ. I would request a CCJ if I have not had contact from Andrew. I assume that it would set up a date and time for a court hearing against him.",Clear on the details. I would just click request. I would expect a judgement to be passed by the court ‘he now has x amount of time to pay…’,Clear on details. It’s the starting process of getting the CCJ started. I know I am registering it.,"Pulling forward from your original application. I would download the claim to see if i’ve made a mistake and to clarify what i’ve done. Close claim - can make the judgement call if he’s paid some/most or you know if they can’t. Stress/annoyance can put you off. Can affect everyone friends, family etc. The responsibility of the Court and hearings can be emotional.","Participants were clear on the process, recognised the details and were aware of what their next steps are",,
3,Request a CCJ confirmed,claimant-dashboard,case?CCJrequested=true&simulateTimePassing=true,dashboard,"Doesn’t tell me a time basis - it could be 6 months. If i hadn’t had any response from the defendant I would give the court a call and ask where am I in the queue - i would like an update from the court. I know the government is overpacked with this kind of thing. Court notification from the gov would be great. I don’t want to be dangled waiting to hear. Contact me via e-mail, it’s a nice thing. Courtesy thing. Your application is complete - defendant pays the court and then the court pays me. If you get no response, 14 days? Bit early? Did it say a time before how long he’s got? [Goes back to page 2] “It doesn’t say a time basis...give me something, he’s got my money.”","Wow. That’s very quick. I’ve now applied for a CCJ. In a way it sounds like it’s still pending - ‘we will contact you if we need more info etc.’ I’m glad as it seems so quick - people could be throwing CCJs about if it’s this easy. Court processes do take a long time. I would like a time frame, there’s nothing at all. Some guidance on time would be good.","Now it’s gone to the court. It’s pretty straightforward. Maybe have some helpful links - guidance, anything you’re not sure on. A chatbox? Arrange a skype meeting with mortgage advisor. I prefer face to face. Rather than e-mails back and forth and waiting on the phone.","The process is complete, they have received it. It will take some time for them to judge. The previous screen said one month so I assume it gives them a month’s notice. It’s better than nothing. It should be done a lot longer than that because of how quick technology is. Next i’d just wait for Court to respond.","Surprised - it seems simplified. It’s a very quick and easy process. You had a claim number before this, a CCJ number now. Should these numbers be the same? For continuity. Could make a mistake and quote the wrong number. Really simple mistakes can be made, one digit out, the whole thing can be thrown out. Blue - clear and unambiguous.",Participants were happy to receive this information about timing and next steps,,
4,Judgement registered email,notifications-claimant,email2,application,"An e-mail! Music to my ears, exactly what I wanted. Fine. As long as they contact me. This is nice, very easy. People will be less worried about how long to wait. I like it.","They will respond in 5 days. AS can’t respond etc...This sounds reasonable. Previous page said they may contact me for further info, so I assume this 5 days is either them asking for info or setting a date. Telling me everything I need to know. Looks like I’m going to get an e-mail. If it’s as smooth as this process, this is extremely user friendly and quick. So much is done by post which slows everything down. He will also be receiving e-mails I assume. A really good way of doing it, as long as this process cannot be abused. AS has the option of responding to this claim though.","Why would he want to contact me by post? As far as i’m concerned, i’m washing my hands of it now, it’s for the courts now. I’ve done what i can previously but now it’s not on me anymore. He’s had his opportunity. It’s starting to get messy so I’d rather not contact him. Court is the middle man now.","Letting me know the court is reviewing in and will respond within 5 days. Can AS not say to the court he’s going to pay? I would like a middle man - AS to contact the middle-man who then speaks to me. I would just want to deal with the court now. I feel like he’s had his opportunity. Things get lost in translation, if he agrees to pay me and then doesn’t - everything should be done by the book now.","Go back to where we’ve gone before. AS had the opportunity of using this online service (matching mirrored record, his part of the claim), now he no longer does. If it’s got to the CCJ now, sod it, once he sees the CCJ - he may offer via post. However he could have no money but you would hope he would actually use that and dispute it. 5 WORKING days. Instead of just days.","One participant was worried about not getting their money back - they would like to know more about the defendant’s financial situation, CCJs etc. at this point",,
5,Apply to court,claimant-dashboard,case?CCJapproved=true,dashboard,"I didn’t know you could freeze money in their bank account - this could get nasty! They might have a family. Charging order is a bit extreme, depends on how much they owe. For 6,000 it’s a bit harsh, maybe if it was 100,000. I agree to bailiffs and taking money out of wages. Bank account is private, i don’t feel comfortable. It depends on how much they owe you. I would start with bailiffs/wages - bit calmer. I would click ‘find out more.’ They’re gonna ask me what option to choose.","He obviously hasn’t paid, no further questions. I can now apply to the court for them to collect payment for me. Does this mean that the judgement has been made? This is what it looks like. It seems swift and easy, even in 5 days. Does this mean there is no actual trip to the court house - cut out the middle man. As someone who had a claim against me, fantastic. As a claimant...I’m surprised.","Great, very happy with this. Expect the bailiff, willing to do taking/freezing money, charging order etc. happy to do any of these to get my money back. Am concerned if he has no money/business etc. You often hear about people who make claims and can’t get their money back. I’d look at company house, where they live, electoral roll - bit of background info. Look at whether it will cost me money to process this further? Other CCJs of AS. Big impact on my decision. Hold on, is this worth pursuing? I’d like to have this information at the beginning before action or even to know now - it’s good to know. It would make me stop now. Could add to page above.

","Given me various options. If i was rich (and had time to wait for the money) then taking money from wages would be an option, i’m guessing you want it ASAP so wouldn’t pick that. Some of them i don’t know the exact process details. I would want the money ASAP. Charging order seems like a long process. Would do first two options. Need to know more about taking money from wages (can’t just be 2 a month).",I can now apply to the court...now find out more. I need an action tab. I take the find out more as an information tab. ‘You can now apply’ instead of ‘find out more’. Otherwise it seems to have ended.,This section prompted participants to consider the monetary risks. They were not 100% confident about their chances of success at this point.,,
6,How to enforce,enforcement-selection,index,application,"Court fees- oh my god. Another cost to you, on top of what you’re claiming for. I’d like to know how much court fees are. No guarantee? Risky take. For that money i’d take the risk. 500 quid, nah. I would just like to know fees, probably would say on the next page. Coming next? Give me the enforcement options.","Yes, every action that is taken adds to his bill but I’m paying it officially. I have a friend who is in the position of paying more in fees than he is actually owed - a defendant who moves and hides from enforcement. Bailiff is probably the best option as you have the option of paying upfront. Friend has been unsuccessful with bailiffs because the defendants are professional scammers, moving around etc. Hard to pin people down with these other options. The options are clear to me but I already know these. Not 100% confident - i would take it a certain distance but wouldn’t want to keep paying fees. There’s a point where I would write it off. With this amount of money I would pursue it a fair distance. Can’t be 100% reassured as people are very slippery. Next - a choice of those options? Bailiff first...then... On a ladder.","A fee! Reminds me of my case. Nothing is for free. You do get it back, but not if there’s not money to get back. Being responsible for all fees worries me - if he has nothing to give. Not sure how much the fee will be, don’t know how many attempts I’ll make. You could rack up a hefty bill here. It would reassure me if there was just a set fee. Outline maximum fee so you know what to expect. Peace of mind that if it’s not going to work out you know how much you’ll be out of pocket - hopefully not much. Maybe add properties they own. Add fees - specific - what you’ll pay. Maybe have some kind of calculator [at this time your court fees stand at…] - coming under details. I expect that it’d give me a choice of options next.","For me, I don’t like the idea that he could get away with not paying, get off scott-free. That aggravates me. If he’s working then there must be a way. If it was the court’s money they would find a way. It should be clean all the way through. ‘Responsible for the fees’ - off-putting, maybe I shouldn’t do it. Discouraging. I understand the bailiff process but need to know more about the other enforcement processes. That would make me feel like discouraged. Would like to know timeframes. Next? Another claim? Breakdown costs, bill-type page and total costs.",Maybe you would have something on this page like a court fee structure unless it’s on the next page. I would expect to see ‘what do you want us to do’ - enforcement options. Fee applicable for each one.,"Participants were glad to see the fees, but concerned that bailiffs’ fees were not specified. They were also unsure whether choosing that option now would trigger action immediately. Participants were still nervous about not knowing enough about the defendant.They wanted more information to help decide which option would be best for their situation",,
7,Type of bailiff,enforcement-selection,bailiffs,application,"Ah, choosing by the criteria! Yes. I didn’t know there were different types of bailiffs. I could live with the 110 fee. They’re all 110. Apply to find out financial situation - i don’t know the guy, his background, he may have a big family and be the only income earner. I know it’s not nice but you have to have a bit of brains not to put a person out of work so they can’t support their family. I would like to know their financial situation - click on that. Some people may be ruthless. Get them to attend court - that’s fine, i can live with the 55 fee. Good to meet face to face. Expect to do for this? [clicks link] Order to attend? This is fine. [Back to 7] I would investigate financial situation - not in every case. I like to check the builders out, their reputation, their past work and clients. Picking them? I get a very good idea. I would pick the bailiffs, or deduct from wages. For more info? I’d click the financial situation link. Oh - is there a helpline or e-mail us and we’ll e-mail back. You’re going to put a guy in real shit so you need to make sure you’re picking the right option. Bailiff - would expect to be told about the process.","You can choose whichever you want to start with. Surprised me because i assumed there’s an escalation process (bailiffs first then so on). Attachment of earnings - won’t work as they could not have enough and they could pay a very small amount a month. Not sure about freezing money. I would google it independently, unless there’s something on the GOV.UK site. There wasn’t info on the previous page, I would like it. Freezing their account doesn’t get you money it just gives the defendant grief. I’m please all those options are there off the bat. I didn’t notice ‘financial situation’ - assume someone is assessing his assets. That’s really interesting because it would help me decide which of these options to pick. A low fee actually for this option. For me, this is the first thing to do before anything choosing of enforcement. Receiving instruction of this may help push the defendant to pay and/or engage. Timescales - a month? This system seems speedy though.","I thought it would be one set fee for all of these (not 110). Depending on the writ the fee changes. How does attachment of earnings work with self-employment? Don’t have enough information at hand. Freeze assets would be good - on the defendant to prove they don’t have saving. I’d go for the bailiffs - the others may be hard to enforce. All methods are clear but the charging order - i’d guess it is against the property/land they own, then proceeds of that are given back to you with your amount. I like that it tells you the court fee. Wouldn’t want to click on it with a sudden 800 pound bill. Would like a rough idea - an average. Financial situation - would think it would give me access to their financial records which i find quite strange. I like this idea - cheap court fee - emphasis is now on them to provide evidence. I do like the idea of this. Why can’t this be an option up there? It should be more prominent. They have to go to court and prove - if they don’t show up then they are culpable, therefore it works in my favour. I would do this first. I would expect this before the CCJ was awarded, earlier in the process, it is quite late in the process to go to court when they already have a CCJ against them.","Breakdown of the process, plus the fee that will be added to the debt. Wouldn’t want to click bailiffs yet as it may be huge fees. Need to know more info about which bailiffs, which fees etc. More information to know what I’m getting myself in for. Alarm bells ring when they can’t tell you too much information because they don’t know who they’re going to use next. Financial situation - like a credit check on AS, CCJ status. It makes sense, but annoying that they charge you to get them to get them to come in. Why can’t they just e-mail them to ask them to send something, it gets rid of the need for a court hearing. If the court try and get hold of him - more confident they would respond to the court than with him - they can give legitimate warnings. May be off-putting to go to court so he would be more likely to instead send info over e-mail. If he had more CCJs, I would get either reduced amount or none at all. Then i’d pick charging order, closest to getting my money back.","Now those four things are re-clarified, and you have the fees to go with it. The bailiff thing - the fee structure if flexible. These fees don’t say whether they include VAT. Most people’s magic word is ‘bailiffs.’ You see it on TV all the time. The other enforcement options are not heard of as often. You think negatively of the bailiffs but bailiffs don’t look for conflict. They understand the risks. Maybe have an information icon there to expand on that - more detail on these processes. GOV.UK has invested money in their website. Communication is their problem, not the information on the website. Financial situation - info supplied by the debtor, by the public domain (HMRC, Experion etc.). Seeing what their credit rating is. There will be stuff in the background, HMRC have access to this kind of information. This provides extra proof. I would base doing this on my gut feeling, of how AS has acted, how he has treated me, the communication/engagement. Bailiff - interest and preference (tend to click on first search result on Google). 
Knowing about AS’s CCJS. It may affect which enforcement option you choose. 
GOV has to be impartial. 
","At first, some participants believed they were eligible for CC bailiffs. They wanted to know if the fee was for the whole 3 attempts or just one",,
8,Before you apply,writs,1,application,"This is what I was thinking about - if he can pay. Exactly - you have to talk to the guy first in the court. I don’t know if he has a disability. I wouldn’t jump in to this first, would get the guy to court first, then I can make a decision. I don’t want to end up paying all the fees. I need to know he can pay otherwise it will cost you more at the end of the day. Confidence about what comes next? Likely outcome, builders aren’t stupid, they probably hide a lot.","That’s making quite clear what the risks are which I would have assumed anyway. In this case, AS, i doubt he would apply for any of those 3 things. I would feel that this is the best option. In order to get back a lot of money, i would risk it. I would want him to suffer, feel the consequences. There’s a moral part here. Just noticing that fee for each attempt part. Judging from this they’ll only visit once. Is there payment? Do you pay in advance?
Knowing AS had other CCJs? If he’s paying them, fine. But if he’s slippery and avoiding them, I would think twice. If he’s owing lots of people lots of money… However a business finds it harder to avoid enforcement and tracing. I would want to know if he paid them. Alarm bells would be ringing though. 77 is not excessive. Swings and roundabouts.

","That’s very clear, it makes sense. I was expecting that. If AS wasn’t able to pay… i was expecting that… i like that big bold warning sign and letters. You could try another time. It suddenly starts making you think, is it worth doing - is it worth all the hassle and stress. I’d still go after it. Expecting a writ to be issued and the bailiffs to be actioned.","Information I need to know - my first question is how am i supposed to know? The way I see it I am asking for help but the court is putting everything on me, they have access to all this info on AS. It seems like they’re trying to put me off - lots of ‘are you sure, are you sure, do you have this etc.’ If i’m paying a fee, they should do some work for it. He could be a complete stranger, he could have lied. You should feel relaxed but I feel on edge if I can’t get these details, how many bailiff visits, can i trust them, all these risks. Not so much comforting but you should feel like you are getting the help you are looking for, not all this pressure. Expect the Court to say they’re going to find out this information and then come back with the information. If he hasn’t responded to the court order to provide info they should warn that they can now go look in his account (give him a chance to do it first and then take control). Why ask me to do it and find this information? (!) I would read this and say ‘no, close’.","I think it is the first time I am seeing Writ of Control - perhaps have a definition needed, I hope it would be at least at the beginning of CMC. Surprised it is the first time writ has been mentioned. There are legal implications behind the vulnerability perspective. Some claimants may just keep going because they want to win, no matter the consequence, just wanting to win an argument. It’s quite clear that you may not win - AS can use many ways to dispute the case. You make a judgement call on whether he has enough money - softskills - his items/phones/car etc. but you can’t truly know. Warning - that should be here - perhaps much earlier on as well - on the original application form. Warning on every single page? Could just ‘sod it i’m going for it’ - told everyone about it so i would. It’s good to know the defendant’s financial situation.","Flagging the potential risk in terms of time and cost was well received “I like that - big bold warning sign and letters. That’s making quite clear what the risks are which I would have assumed anyway.” “I wouldn’t jump in to this first, would get the guy to court first, then I can make a decision. I don’t want to end up paying all the fees.”","Consider signposting key terms earlier “I think it is the first time I am seeing ‘Writ of Control’ - perhaps have a definition needed, I hope it would be at least at the beginning of CMC. Surprised it is the first time writ has been mentioned”",
9,Do you think defendant can pay?,writs,3,application,"Is this without seeing him first or with seeing? It should give you a ‘not sure’ option - if you haven’t seen him yet, how can you guess? It’s all guess work. 9/10 they do a bunk somewhere","That’s the 6000 pound question. Cannot imagine what would happen if I say no? Have to say yes to carry on the process. If I say no…’thank you and goodbye’? Bit puzzled by this question, it’s weird.","If AS has work van, tools etc. it can be taken and sold.",I don’t know. I don’t know him. I can’t answer either side as I have no idea. I would only hope he can pay me back.,"You’d hope that you would know that he could here? It could give them the opportunity to think about whether he could - a reality check. A good idea, whether at this stage i don’t know. Thinking about whether it’s worth it.",,"Many participants were thrown by this question - “It should give you a ‘not sure’ option - if you haven’t seen him
yet, how can you guess? It’s all guess work.”
“That’s the £6000 question. Cannot imagine what would happen
if I say no? Have to say yes to carry on the process. If I say
no…’thank you and goodbye’?”
“Bit puzzled by this question, it’s weird.”
“I don’t know. I don’t know him. I can’t answer either side as I
have no idea. I would only hope he can pay me back.”",
10,Has defendant paid any of the amount on the County Court Judgment,writs,4,application,No.,"Haven’t heard from him, so no. A fair question. If i say yes they’d ask how much.",no ,No,Assume no,,,
11,Do you want the bailiff to collect the full debt?,writs,5,,"Yes, of course I do! If he’s vulnerable maybe not all. But go all in at first.","That’s got to be a yes. Answer no only if it was more realistic to get 2,000. Would be given options about how much to recover. Because it’s a business and he’s taking the mickey i’d click yes.","I would like it in full. If they make a payment plan with the bailiffs, who tells me? Is that between him and the bailiffs. I’d only select no if I knew he couldn’t pay it all.","Yes… why wouldn’t I? I can’t think of why i’d click no, he robbed me and damaged my roof. Bailiffs arranging payment plan / partial payment is at a later date when they actually get into contact with him.","That makes sense. I assume there would be something saying ‘there’s no point of return’ after clicking yes. Maybe credit card stage is the final no point of return. I may take 50%, would no give you an option to write how much you want? (yes)",,This question also led to come confusion,
12,Is this the address you want the bailiff to visit?,writs,7,,9/10 you already put in claim where he lives.,"If i had another address I would give it, which is good to know. Offering multiple addresses, maybe a phone number?","Yes. If i had other addresses like work addresses, i would add them in. No - then given the option to add more.","Yes, the address he provided me with. Again they’re asking me too many things to make this go wrong. 6 addresses and this is the one I think it is - already one visit I’ve paid for wrongly. The court should be checking if it is the right address. They should check if they have had no response to court communication from the address. They could throw the case out of the window. They can find out where does his payslips go to etc. Scaring someone and paying unnecessarily.",Has to be a legal reason as to why you provided the address.,Participants liked being able to provide as much information about the defendant as possible...but were concerned about the possible consequences of providing incorrect information,,
13,Do you have additional contact information for the defendant?,writs,8,,Two numbers. Clever builder can get rid of the sim if he owes lots of people money. And an e-mail address. ‘Add more details’ - e-mail and more numbers. Put everything. Information is power.,"Ah yes, excellent. Add contact details - other e-mails, other phone numbers, social media - anything to get a hook on.",Yes. Again if I had more numbers I would add them.,"Yes, assume I have spoken to him regarding the building work. He may have multiple phones, an e-mail address - would add any source that can help the court get into contact. I understand this kind of question as I may have had this kind of information. Give as much as possible.","Yes. He could have multiple numbers so I would provide these. Should have phone number format [+44] [xxxxxx]. Add more details - email, added info, car details, photos of car/person, associations with people (other forms of evidence) etc. (doesn’t assume other mobile phone numbers can be added here)","There were similar responses to the previous screen - “I’d put everything. Information is power.
Add contact details - other e-mails, other phone
numbers, social media - anything to get a hook on…..”
“...email, added info, car details, photos of car/person,
associations with people (other forms of evidence)”",,
14,Do you know which high court bailiff you want to use?,writs,select-hceo,,"? Where is the list? Otherwise, select bailiff for me. Potential list - the most successful bailiff, who get the best results. I would google them. I don’t know how the court picks the bailiff. I never knew this would come up, didn’t expect this. If i had chosen yes - I need to be the one to enter it. I would expect a list to choose from.","I can’t remember the names offhand - so yes you could enter it. I would go with no, they all cost the same 77, presumably all know what they’re doing. I would only care if I had had a bad experience with one of them or seen something bad on TV. I would expect a drop down menu and contact details. I would pick off of recognition.","No, I guess it’s whatever works geographically. That’s what I would expect. I wouldn’t really ever have a name for me. I’m happy for the court to choose unless someone recommended one.","No...why would I know? Off-putting as I don’t know the fees of the HCEO they’ve chosen. Help you to find a HCEO that is fair, reputable company - they are willing to have a discussion with AS. I’d like to know it was selected from good places rather than anyone that they can get a hold of. I hate the bailiffs, ignored them, they were aggressive. If someone actually had a conversation with me, they are more likely to get the kind of response that they want.","I’d not really know what this meant (a person, a particular court etc.), doesn’t clarify. I do know it has to be within the geographical area. Needs more information here. Criteria etc. Never seen that question before.","Not many participants were expecting to be given a choice, and there were concerns over who might be on that list",,
15,Check your answers,writs,check-answers,application,"Where is the list of bailiffs? I don’t get it. Court to select. Ah I told them. Only thing I would like to know is the bailiff company, but that’s all.","This is good as nothing has been in written in stone yet. You have the ability to change. Don’t know bailiff yet, i guess they pick who is available. Has everything I hoped would be there. All of this I’m doing myself. My friend has been paying a solicitor to do this. It’s def preferable to not pay the solicitor and do this yourself, i would tell him about this.",Pre-application before I submit.,"Confirming details, options to change everything. Yep.","Have the ability to change all these things in case you have made an error. Confirms everything you have done. Legal declaration, nice and short unlike some T&Cs. ‘You are still allowed to edit things’ message would be good after ticking the box.","This is a standard gov.uk pattern, and participants found it reassuring to still be able to edit their information at this point",,
16,Confirmation,writs,confirmation-page,application,You’re sending the information to the bailiff. I’ve paid the fee and you’re sending it to the bailiff.,That’s clear. It makes sense.,We’ve paid for the writ and it’s been sent to the bailiff - they have been instructed. Now I have to send the writ of control.,Payment accepted and it’s all gone through.,"You have made an application and are now enforcing the judgment. Another reference number - now got 3 numbers. I would want a physical letter, don’t trust GOV to email me. If i had an account with GOV.UK, if that was set internally I wouldn’t mind. There’s a lot of scam emails nowadays.",,"“Another reference number - [I’ve] now got 3 numbers!” Should there be somewhere all these reference numbers are held for easy access and to keep track of them? One participant wanted a physical letter
of confirmation due to the prevalence of
scam emails - although if received
internally via their GOV.UK account
that would be acceptable.",
17,Claimant dashboard - Writ of Control approved,claimant-dashboard,case?writApproved=true&writReady=true,application,This is sending the details to the account. I would think that there must be a link to the bailiff from this system. Don’t want court involved. It has to be direct. What bailiff will do - I want to see this. They’re still not telling you the company you are using. After this I expect that it’s confirmed with the bailiff.,"I’d still want to look at what ‘a bailiff would do’ - Yep, perfect, it’s what I expected. Next, I would expect like a confirmation - starting the process.","I would click to see what the bailiff can do. I would then send it off. This page is just detailing what the next stage would be, timescales, payment plans etc. Everything there is what I expect.","I’ve been through this so I know this. This is fine. Basically outlining what you need to know about the process. My issue would be - time-frames, how long would they visit after the 7 day period. What is the process after a first failed visit. Do they ring the defendant? Do all bailiffs do that? [Send writ] - assume it goes directly to bailiff.",Send writ of control - that hasn’t happened in the past once you’ve paid you money. I would expect that to happen since that is what I’m used to and it is just another thing for you to do. Once you have paid your money the writ should be sent. Maybe there is a legal thing.,,“[It’s] still not telling you the company that you are using.”,
18,Claimant dashboard - Writ of Control sent to HCEO,claimant-dashboard,case?writServed=true&simulateTimePassing=true&enforcementInPlay=true,,"What I expected. Simple. Not hard work. I would encourage people to see the guy first before all this action. If he is physically disabled you’re spending money for no reason. Need medical evidence early in the process, before I started all this. Have to be a bit conservative. If he had no engagement then send the bailiffs definitely. Nothing more to know, I’m happy. Timeframe? Within 7 days.",Doesn’t give any timings which I would be curious about. Maybe ‘in the next 4 weeks’ etc. Handy to know. Good that you can take steps if some payment has been made. I wonder if you get the 77 back if you cancel the writ. I assume you would not get the money back. Perhaps he has paid because of the threat of action.,Ok. Maybe add some links to help. FAQ? Chatbot. Nothing there for if you have questions.,Ok cool. It’s done the work that I said I would prefer them to do. That download and send e-mail before? Is that a step before? (Clash with email). I didn’t understand that they would send it for me.,Should also add that you won’t get money back if you cancel.,,There was some confusion about the process of sending the Writ to the HCEOs - conflicting with information on email?,
,SUMMARY FEEDBACK,summary,,,"50:30 - Not as frightening as my own process as it's laid out clearly and you're not filling out paper forms (errors hard to change), I can edit choices. So much easier than my own process. 51.15 - the drop down menu explaining terms. Some kind of email would be very helpful if you get stuck. It would be really helpful, speaking to a human being (with anything, not just court). Put your mind at rest. A real necessity when you do things online. 53 - I'd like a call from the bailiff saying they've got the money. Even a text asking her to call. Help my worries. I don't know how the actual bailliff service works...so communication throughout would be good. ",,,,"47.10 name - bit long isn't it? sounds less serious - needs to be serious.  no i think it needs to be called 'court' something. 48.34 yeah fine in summary - quite simple (like HMRC) uncomplicated and clear. how it needs to be. everyone's different. 51.25 should't be put off eveyine should have a chance to get their money back. if you're on a low income - how you can claim.
