1,,notifications-defendant,email2,email,"It's telling me that a bailiff is being sent by the High Court and must pay the fees. I can set up a payment plan and there are next steps. They're telling me what they're going to do (in my experience they don't always do it in that order). The steps are clear and straightforward - their steps, my potential steps and the consequences. Easy to understand. There are no dates. For me, we should be given a timescale e.g. 'do this by this date otherwise.../from this action do this...at this point... etc.' From here, I would be on the phone to defend myself. I would like to defend myself. However there is no number, I would expect some form on contact information. Calls are recorded which is good. The green button would take me to the GOV site, probably a place for me to put a reference number here - the claim number at the top. Input personal details etc.","Definetley from the Court. It's giving me options. I would like to see the amount and some more information about the payment plan. Minimum payment for the plan. Maybe a phone number for the Court or the HCEO to provide more detail. Next I'd view the claim details and would dispute it, stop the writ. I'd appeal. Maybe I need a lawyer as I haven't done anything wrong. Green button - expect to go to the application to stop it.","Good to have claim number so you can call and confirm it is genuine. Bailiffs now have the authority to attend to take goods, I know what they cannot take. There are options to stop it - nowhere does it say I can challenge it, I expect that. A letter from the court, your heart sinks, anxiety, worry. You're on edge waiting for the bailiff to come, warn the children. Next I would contact that court to check it's a genuine claim. Want to learn how I can stop it after learning more about the case. I would phone - not the easiest to contact them - would also send an e-mail. Would click the green box - I expect it to take me to the government website and directly to my claim. ","It sends shivers down my spine. I was not offered help in my case, the council presumed I was guilty. Advised to speak to stepchange. There was no help, only about how to pay it - but she does not owe the money. Scaremongering. It's too easy to make a claim. Needs to be a mediator. They are offering a little door - stopping the writ - it doesn't always work. I would not contact Kate, I would contact the court, go to CAB even though it is difficult to see them. Green button - expect to go to the Writ.","It's a notification from the Court, bailiffs have the go-ahead. Set up a plan if you can. You can stop a Writ. As a builder, I would stop the writ, as I am satisfied with my work. I would click the green button where I can view the claim and follow the process to stop the writ. As a builder who has done many jobs I may need some more detail, the address, the name etc. so i can check who made the claim. There is no amount. This useful information should be upfront and not require me to search.","Expectations of the green button matches reality.
It is clear who the email is from and what is going to happen, as well as the steps, choice and the consequences.","Contact details are needed.
Timescales of the process and dates are needed.
Amount of debt owed and information about the claimant is needed so that the defendant can check who the claimant is.
There is a misudnerstanding for some participants who don't associate stopping a writ with 'challenging the debt'.

I expect personal details,The number at the top of the email would be put here.,Ok need to go back and take the number from the top of the e-mail.,Is DF... the number? I would find the number on the letter - [goes back] - it's at the top. Hadn't noticed it before.,Yes I saw the claim number before on the e-mail.,"All participants expected this and knew where to get the claim number from.
",,
3,,security-layer,request-code,dashboard,"[Maybe make it clearer this is a different detail to input, she skipped past it thinking it was the previous one]. This is so important I would expect to enter my DOB.","My number, ok.","I think it's okay because you want people to be able to call you back. Nothing wrong with this. E-mail should be compulsary, phone should be optional.",If I have nothing to hide I don't care about entering this.,I wouldn't be so willing - they have my address/email - why does the Court need my phone number?,4 accepted this - it is normal and familiar.,1 was unwilling due to distrust “they already have my e-mail and address.”,
4,,security-layer,enter-code,application,"This is good I like that. I've done this before with lots of other things. I prefer this to DOB, sometimes you are at work, not dealing with this at home. Having this on my phone is a bit more private and secure.","Great. I don't mind that that because my phone is handy to me. But...if my phone isn't with me or I don't have one, maybe send to my e-mail. It should be an option to send an e-mail.","It's kind of the norm nowadays, no problem.",This is very useful because of all the scams going on.,"Bit too personal, getting closer to me. Would be comfortable with post only.",4 liked this idea. It was a familiar way of securing their claim and checking it was genuine.,1 was distrusting and felt that this was too personal.,
5,Dashboard ,defendant-dashboard,"case?writApproved=true""",dashboard,"Summarising the case against me. I can view all the information. It's actually showing you what the fees are. (She's not sure if she paid fees or if it was given back to her). Claim history - I would expect a condensed, more to the point journey of what has happened. (clicks) Failed to respond...I can see from this the date that I didn't fail. You are not kept in the dark, this is not like what happened to me where I was kept in the dark. If I clicked on CCJ i would like a breakdown, I would expect a dropbox of how long it stays on your name etc. etc. They've covered everything that I expect. Parties (clicks) all the contact details, that's all it really needs, expects nothing else. Documents (clicks) I expect any supporting evidence from Kate should be there. if I had this option I could have responded to the documents uploaded, so they have an insight into what you've got to say. Validating evidence is important. Then, no need to go to court. Court departments don't liase with eachother. I could tell the claimant my side, my documents evidence. An option to upload supporting evidence would be good. [Going back to pay] - thinking about clicking back but I know some sites don't like that. I would click actions you would take [took a little time to decide this] - here I can pay. This was not immediatley obvious. Actions to take reworded? I expected to go up - not into a tab. If I wanted to pay I expect it to go to a page showing the amount, the claimant details, my details etc. Would like to print it to prove that I paid. If I didn't want to pay I'd click the second option. I'd assume that I'd get all the information and details again and then an application to stop it and it should tell me what will happen, with drop down boxes explaining things.","This is the actual writ and the amount I owe, the date. I would apply to cancel or vary - I feel like I don't need to pay. Before I do that I'd look at the claim history (click) Kate, the person I did work for, shows her actions and applications. Shows I didn't respond. It's quite straightforward. I like that it has times and dates, so it's not confusing. Parties...the lady I have done the work for and me. I quite like it. Is it confidential to have her address...although I've done work for her so I know it. Maybe to see her or my own representation. Documents...would that be my documents I provided? I would expect so. E.g. my passport, pictures of the work I've done - at least note that 'Andrew has provided photographic evidence of the building' or 'Kate has provided photographic evidence of errors in Andrew's building work.' I'd go back to actions if I was making a payment in full, I'd expect it to go to a summary asking if you're clear that you're paying it then ways of paying etc. Otherwise, would click second option of staying a writ. Expect long application, reasons, someone checking - it won't be quick. Need evidence.","The writ itself. Details of the case. Should be more options here, like the appeal [is this not the same as stopping a writ]? Why should they have to pay to challenge? Do you get that fee refunded? Claim details -You have reasonable amount of time to respond. Doesn't have exact details of contact method [e.g. letter etc.] CCJ click would come up with actual document. CCJs are serious, affects your credit. Need the amount and claimant details on this. Incorrect date 25th Nov should be 25th Oct. I would like to know which Court this is based at, so I can contact them. Parties - should the claimant's address be there? People can be a little crazy, the defendant could go to Kate's house, things can get out of hand. Wouldn't be comfortable as a claimant having my details disclosed. Is this where the work took place or where she lives? Rest of details are fine. My home address [defendant]....no...maybe just the area of the first half of the postcode. Just the proximity. Should only be disclosed to the Court not the other parties. Address should be hidden from both parties. Documents, I would expect to see any evidence, forms etc. submitted by the court and claimant - like the claim history - click on each stage and it takes you to document section with the relevant and corresponding evidence. I would expect to see what Kate submitted, e.g. claim form, her fee payment, evidence of reasons for making a claim. Paying in full - would go back to actions and the first link. I would expect it to take me to a payment page that reiterates claim details, amount, date, parties information etc. and pay now option. Maybe also a declaration checkbox, so there is no appeal. When you cannot click through if you haven't checked a box you tend to pay attention. Don't want to pay - second link. I would expect to to take me to, similarly as above, case details, reiterate the eligibility, complusary to select one of the two elgibility requirements, a box to explain things, attaching documents etc.","255 fee - do I have to pay this to stop the writ? Yes. I would apply to stop the writ. People would pay if they're scared even if it's an error. I wouldn't be very happy here. Claim history - is that against me...? Not quite sure. [click] Oh, from the minute she made a claim against me. Andrew probably ignored it because he was scared - say 'please' when you address defendants early on. 'Please take this seriously as it has serious consequences...if you are not the guilty party please do the following immediatley.' Parties - not much else needs to be added. Maybe an account of what Kate stated as her reasoning behind making the claim - put this in claim history. Documents - original quote/contract. What to do next - I need to take action [returns to first tab] - i would click the first link - I would expect it to take me to a payment page. I would click the second link to cancel the writ.","Got the name of the claimant. I like the fact that I've got all the relevant information - grey box stands out - that's what hits me now. Giving me the actions - pay it off or stop it. Why am I paying a fee? Why not go to court and discuss? Another financial burden on top of the debt. Fingers are pointed at me saying I'm guilty and now I must pay to stop it. It's burning to see that fee. I would find a legal representative. Claim history - dates and times - CCJ link would have more details of the claim itself. Perhaps seeing it the other way around? Still understandable. Parties - I wouldn't want to provide my personal email - legal not personal. These personal details - I'm not comfortable having this here. Documents - photographs from Kate - i need to know why Kate has made a claim. Actions you can take - pay in full - I would expect that it would take me to a payment page much like shopping online. Gives me peace of mind that it would be finsh. The top section is negative, it makes me feel at fault, the court is not encouraging you to stop the writ. Feels the court is assuming guilty. Stop the writ - the second link - I would expect it to take me to.","Participants liked that the fees were showed upfront. 
""You are not kept in the dark."" 
Participants liked the fact that evidence could be uploaded to document as it provides better insight into the case and helps to validate either side's argument.
Expectations matched reality for the next steps.
It was helpful to have times and dates in the claim history. 
Relevant information in the grey box stands out.","Reword 'actions to take' to make it clearer wher to go next (only 1 participant had trouble with this).
Concerns over 'Parties' - confidentiality of personal details. Suggestions to improve this include showing partials and only allow the Court and internal system to have access to this information.
Clarity of fees is required - whether you get these refunded and under what circumstances.
Declaration checkbox would be useful, so there is no appeal and you are forced to read the content carefully before continuing.
There was a feeling that the Gov/Court is assuming guilty and discouraging you from stopping the Writ (2 participants).

6,,stay-writ,index,application,"I like that. That's lovely. Very clear, easy and simple",Change the payments on my CCJ - not clear - this would be if I had set up a payment plan and I want to change it. Cancel is cancel it completely.,Change the payments...am i offering to pay a less amount or in installments? Still obligated to pay. Need more explaination. Change it how? Cancel CCJ - straightforward.,-,"Again, no mention of the notion that I may not be guilty. Would cancel.",A clear and simple question.,"Change payments' need clarification in terms of the process, what exactly you are changing and the eligibility.
""No mention that I may not be guilty"" - A common thread throughout the process for 2 participants was that they felt that asking how they wanted to mangage their debt meant that they were being accused of being guilty.",
7,,stay-writ,2,application,"You're hitting the problem straight on with the hearing. Telephone/online - I would prefer to go but it's good for people who can't travel or if you're busy. I didn't know they did those. There's more impact going to a hearing in person. Telephone hearing is good as you have your family with you, as opposed to court where you are standing alone. Actually I would have preferred a telephone hearing, I knew I was in the right but I was angry and annoyed - I was shaking when I got there. 'I don't want a hearing' - proabably another option, not sure what what happen if I clicked. Other options...maybe type up what I need to say about it then someone would make a decision on it.",At this point I don't want a hearing...just want to cancel it. Some people would like to see them face to face...others like being at home...some just don't want any hearing. I would go to a court room as Kate is accusing me of damaging her roof and I want to justify myself and show photographic evidence.,"Wouldn't want a hearing, I'm busy. Court at a set time and could be there for hours. Telephone/video is good as some people find it easier. Everyone has a phone, you can make yourself available to take the phone call whilst still getting on with things. Perhaps include approximate timescales of hearings (both in person and telephone/video). Only click 'don't want' if you have strong evidence.",Have to be a hearing in a court room if you don't have an impairment. It's fairer to be face to face. Not wanting a hearing implies you are guilty. ,"Have a telephone/video hearing as long as it is two way. Why? Because as Andrew I've never been to court. The idea of it is daunting. It's more comfortable because I'm in my own surroundings. Why would you not want a hearing, if you're not guilty, then why not? Otherwise it's in someone else's hands.","Participants liked the idea of remote hearings, although they felt that face to face hearings would be more impactful and work in their favour.
""You're hitting the problem straight on with the hearing.""","They could not see why you would not want a hearing, ""If you're not guilty then why not? Otherwise it's in someone else's hands.""
Include approximate times of hearings to help people make a choice.

Would have uploaded my self-employed log of my work, timings, things that were covering me.

Expect that next...they will tell me the expected timescale, what actions would happen and so on.","This is quite good. I like that I can explain my story. Ooh, evidence, like I said I've got my pictures. Probably add recipets of payments, extra work I did to the roof, supporting documents of my past work.","This is what I was saying before. The evidence alone may not paint a clear picture, may need to be explained. Good to have the option to upload files. Proof of paymeny, communication between us, photos etc. Is there a restriction on the amount of files? Size etc? Need clarification. Even videos nowadays, to provide stronger genuine evidence. ","I would provide my account of the situation in this box.

9,,stay-writ,check-answers,application,"You can still change, it's always giving you an option which is good as you could change your mind.","Yep. I'd like a summary of the information I entered on the previous page. Can change something quickly then. Green button - go to a payment option. I like that you don't have to pay if you're on low income (on dashboard). It should ask you whether you can pay this, upload payslip etc. (before it even comes close to payment). ","Clarification and confirmation of what I want to do. I'm agreeing to pay. Not sure what the next steps are - would like to know before I make payment. Timescales, journey, what's next, response time etc. Clarify that this does not mean that it's cancelled and the bailiffs cannot proceed.

If you commit to paying, the odds are you are not guilty as you are prepared to pay. It doesn't say anywhere go to CAB, consult a solicitor.

The declaration and payment - my blood pressure would increase - I don't want to pay. Has Kate paid 255? She will get it back if she wins. I have to look at the big picture [faith in evidence and success of case], more willing to pay. If I had doubt about my work then I would just pay the debt.

If I had doubt about the quality of my work then I would just pay the debt.""","Participants would have liked to see their reasons and evidence from the previous page here, with the same opportunity to change it.

I only knew not to open the door to bailiffs, would like to know my rights.","Always good to have reference in bold and blue - in your face, you know it's gone through. Next steps - good information, I may have other debt. It's quite helpful. So many people don't know their rights with bailiffs, I like that the information is there. ","That's good, the guidance. In general, people have struggles with debt, helpful for anybody really. Also good to have information about what a CCJ is and the impact on your credit.","I would print this page out. Would show the bailiff if they show up as departments don't always talk to eachother. Under next steps - they're still assuming I have one, change language to 'should' - don't assume guilt. Using bailiff as a threat and to create a daunting environment. Next steps should not be here, just thank you full stop. Next steps and bailiff help should be on another page. I assume here the CCJ has been set aside. [told it's not] Oh. I'm worried, the bailiffs can still come and get something, departments don't talk to eachother. I thought I had stopped it. I would want to hear back immediatley. It can take many months. In my case, the council kept hounding.","Next steps - assumes I am in debt. I am expecting a bailiff visit, this information is there for me. This would be irrelevant because I've put an application to stop the writ. I'd take a picture for evidence then wait for a letter/call from the court for the next hearing. I believe that I had stopped the writ as I've paid.

11,Check doc,documents,noe,,"Okay! I never knew about this. So if they gave me this, especially on the computer,  that is so much better than just a 'you got to pay the money or else...' There is help you can get. Urgent help and advice...Paying all the money in one go is hard. You have your rights - more insights, that's really good, currently we don't get that option and we panic. Helps you to deal with the situation, you have more avenues to go down to deal with the debt. More choices.","This is quite good information that they've given me. I would go for this option [vailidate] to make sure what they're doing is right. I would need this letter to be given to me when I have time to read it - not when a bailiff is shoving it in my face. Sometimes you just rip up letters sent to you. When my letters started to get serious you want to have a good look at it. I need the bailiffs to explain it and be helpful, providing options, then they wouldn't be so scary and have the door slammed. I'd click verify.","This is good because there is so much fraud e.g. gas engineer fraud. At least you can verify the person is genuine. There is also help about managing debt etc. I would need to have a bit of time to look through this, a short time period for a response from my side. There is nothing here about challenging - if I believe I don't owe the money. Digital or physical? Doesn't really matter. I would expect to take something away though as I cannot take their ipad.","She sees this as them accusing her of being guilty, because of the mention of debt. Reading this makes me feel horrible, panicked. Leave this man at the door whilst you go on the computer. Focused on getting the money, the scaring thing. Fear of court. Ill relatives.

Participants thought it contained a lot of useful information.
The validation option would help to counteract fraud and scams, which participants did often worry about","Participants would have liked to receive this prior to a bailiff visit as they would need some time to read through this and take action, which would not be possible with a bailiff on the doorstep.
The same 2 participants who felt strongly about being accused of being guilty said that this document held no value for them as they felt they were not being reassured that there was a path to take if they wanted to challenge the debt.",
12,,documents,writ,,"Looks familiar. They want to take my goods now that I've opened the door. You only have your side of the story - you are backed into a corner. It has more fees on top of the debt. You don't want to pay it. As Andrew there is no way for you to turn. Offer some money or let him in. Nothing for me to do. Digital or a print out? Would not matter. We're moving forward with technology and trying to get rid of paper. Once I see their ID and I can see all the case details, it's fine.","Telling me the debt has gone overboard and they will take goods if I don't pay. I would feel worried. Court fees now, extra charges. All this interest... At this point I would phone up to try and set up a payment plan or take it higher and appeal. There should be a phone number - it would probably be for the bailiff on this letter. Would rather talk to High Court as bailiffs just pressure you to pay and don't provide options. Showing on an ipad...wouldn't take it as seriously as when they hand a letter. If they're nice bailiffs who are helpful maybe I'd accept it. ","I would want to know from the court officer about what action I can take e.g. freeze action for 24 hours. Know from TV that they can still take action from outside. Honestly, my hopes would be dire in receiving this.","I know that people would dispute that they are Andrew Smith. If goods are taken and you are proven not guilty do you get your goods back? I'd like to think so. I'm aware they have to take goods amounting to the debt owed or take the money if i have it AND to pay for the privilige. Plus plus plus. I want it as paper not digital, I need to sign something don't i? If i didn't believe it was valid I would ask them to go away.","Looks official. Aware of what the bailiffs can do. All the fees clearly laid out. I should have paid or applied to cancel it once I saw this. Lost for words with the bailiff. Offer to pay the debt without the fees. Don't want the tablet option - it is not tablet, it is not black and white, i am more old school. I question the legitimacy of digital.",The Writ made a significant impact on participants who were reminded of the seriousness of the situation.,"Include contact details so that defendants can discuss their options and payment.

So much easier than my own process. 51.15 - the drop down menu explaining terms. Some kind of email would be very helpful if you get stuck. It would be really helpful, speaking to a human being (with anything, not just court). Put your mind at rest. A real necessity when you do things online. 53 - I'd like a call from the bailiff saying they've got the money. Even a text asking her to call. Help my worries. I don't know how the actual bailliff service works...so communication throughout would be good.
