1,CCJ application email,notifications-claimant,email1,email,10:00 - She can apply for a CCJ but doesn't understand whether there has been previous negotiation. The government doesn't know if it is my fault or his. You are encouraged to mediate with legal things. I'd do a series of increasingly less polite letters. Would you know what a CCJ is and what the way forward is? I'd apply.,"7.49 click on that thing to get a CCJ and hopefully they'll pay up. obvious, easy. i'd press it yes","Overall, it was clear what was happening and what the next steps were.",- It would be useful to have a further explanation of what a CCJ is. - One participant was surprised there was no mention of mediation (when they saw the claim history later on they realized how much had already been attempted),https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EH0e_5XGRjCAK46g60uYioSvlonCTLC-/view?usp=sharing
2,Case dashboard,claimant-dashboard,case,application,12:24 - I'd look at claim history. I have gone through a process already. Useful to see who the people are and the documents. Actions you can take - (13:25) - what do I do with the proof? Reciepts. Options are close or take the next legal step. 14:15 - needs a button that says 'need help' like a dictionary of legal terms. ,8.22 giving you what you can do next. if they've paid it you can tell them now. will mr smith know this is happening? received an email or letter? is this an office of solicitors delaing with this? 9.20 unclear who's making these decisions. 10.07 more information needed here - do you agree with this yes or no? should be more in the loop - extending it is making it more messy. 11.15 parties - would you not want the other person to see where you live? sometimes quite nasty people .- better just your name 11.55 want to see proof and their documents- mine are all whats app msgs - quite hard- unless i take screenshots.  ,"Overall, it was beneficial to have everything in one place.
● Claim history was especially popular as it brought participants into the loop and showed them everything that had been done prior.
● Participants liked documents as they felt that being able to view their own and the defendant’s evidence was very useful.","A button for help or contact details would reassure participants and allow them to have any questions or concerns addressed.
● In the same vein, having a dictionary or glossary of legal terms available would be useful.
● One participant was unclear who had made certain decisions throughout the claim history, and would have liked names.
● One participant was unsure whether Andrew Smith knew if any of this was happening.
● In regards to ‘Parties’ - “Things could get nasty if people know your address.”",
3,Request a CCJ confirmed,,,application,"15:25 - I've done it. There's my ref number. I'd take a screen grab, make a folder and put everything in there. 15.50 - I always want to come back to pages. I'd expect to log in with a password. I'd screengrab anything I find useful, reading things during dead time. 17:15 - provide a contact email for help, to assure you you're doing things right. Some kind of help button. 17:45 - 'contact about application' that makes me nervous, I feel like I've done something wrong, I want a time scale. For help, it should be someone who knows about CCJs, 18;40 - you need things like this because they can be quite scary.",13.30 yes fine this page. i'd take the ref numbers down. 13.52 - no other extra info on this page needed. 14.03 - expect to get an email saying what i've done. timeline of what to do and by when.,"Participants were clear that an
application had to be made.
● They liked the reference number
and wanted to make a note of it.
● “I always want to come back to
these pages” (a need for save and
return)","Again, there was a need for a
help button or contact details.
● Participants expected a timeline
of what would happen and what
steps they would need to take.
● Participants expected an e-mail
confirming this plus extra details.",
4,CCJ requested,claimant-dashboard,case?CCJrequested=true&simulateTimePassing=true,application,19:15 - the timescale should be on the previous page. 19:30 - it's good you have the option to to close the claim at all these stages in case he pays.,15.19 that wasn't clear that application made but not confirmed. 15.47 - after 5 days they'll tell me yes or no,"Participants liked having the
option to close the claim
re-occur throughout, as there was
always a possibility that Andrew
could pay.
● It was clear what was going to
happen in this timeframe.","The timescale of 5 days should
be shown on the previous page.
● It was not completely clear that
only an application had been
made and that it was yet to be
approved on this or the previous
page.",
5,Judgement registered email,notifications-claimant,email2,dashboard,"20:30 - Gives me options of what happens and how to get the money back. 21 - I'd like the options to be linked to more info. 21.15 - why is there no option to mediate in court, only then should it go further. 21.55 - Freezing money is probably the quickest. I'd like more of an explaination. ",16.12 how do they collect the money then? is it like 'can't pay we'll take it away' 16.43 it's exactly what i want to happen - i'm hoping he doesn't respond. 17.18 in my head he's going to pay anyway so i'm going to get it back. 17.40 i'm happy in the knowledge that i'm causing him prorlblems. 17.55 concern - is there a danger that money can make fake claims to people i hate? maybe it needs to be drummed into claimants' head that it's serious. feels like info page rather than taking action. 20.27 maybe wouldn't have [CTA] as link but better as button?,"“It’s exactly what I want to happen… now I don’t
want him to respond.”
● “I’m happy in the knowledge that I’m causing
problems.”
● Participants were happy with the way things were
progressing and getting their money back started to
become more of a reality.","Having links from each of the enforcement options
to further guidance would be useful for participants.
● One participant was surprised not to see an option
to mediate included.
● One participant was worried that making a claim
seemed too easy and that anyone could do it for any
reason.
● The ‘Find out more’ link did not feel like a Call To
Action (reword or have it as a big green button).",
8,Apply to court,claimant-dashboard,case?CCJapproved=true,application,"22:55 - I'd like a link from these options to see what it involves and what it costs. What if I don't get the money back. Court fees make sense. Costs add up if he moves his bank money around. 23.55 - info, costs list next to each option. I expect to fill out a form.",20.46 now back into our account 21.30 i thought it was guaranteed that bailiffs would sit there until bloke coughed up the money. 21.45 how would i freeze the account? 21.55 now i would need to talk to someone - it's gone into 'sticky' phase 22.52 this isn't what i thought would happen - do we not go to a court then? i thought i was going to court.   23.55 should be made clearer it's the final stage of enforcement. 25.30 i would need to see how much it's going to cost. 26.00 is this immediate if i click button?,,"“Now I need to talk to
someone...this is the sticky
stage.” - Things feel more serious
now and the participant needs
further help.
● Participants need to see how
much these options cost and
further guidance on each one.
● One participant was worried that
clicking the green button would
result in immediate and
irreversible action.",
9,How to enforce,enforcement-selection,index,application,25 - Never been to his house,,,,
,Has he paid anything yet?,enforcement-selection,ccj-paid,,,,,,
10,Can he pay?,enforcement-selection,1,application,,26.42 they're double checking. 26.50 but i don't know andrew smith,,,
11,What do you know about him?,enforcement-selection,2,application,"25:45 - they're trying to find out what he's worth. 26.15 - ah this explains it, but I'd like it earlier. A great way of doing it. I'd like it like a pop-up that remains on the page, so I don't leave the page to make a decision. 29:10 - choose bank so I'd have that after paying him. 29:30 - it's good, says everything I need it to.",27.12 i know his address. i know his current address. 27.30 i don't know what it achieves (charging order) - surely just inconveniences him if he wants to sell his house - doesn't mean I'll get my money. 28.50 needs more info - how do you freeze assets???,"“A great way of revealing
information”
● “Says everything I need it to.”","Participants wanted this drop
down information earlier in the
process.
● “I’d like this information to remain
as a pop-up throughout so I
don’t have to go back and forth
to make a decision.”
● “What does a charging order
achieve? How do you freeze
assets?” - further details are
needed.",
12,Summary of previous answers,enforcement-selection,options,application,,29.40 send bailiffs sound the best - attending court - what does that achieve? 30.20 if AS is not responding - maybe there's a reason. maybe he's dead?!,"Participants felt that sending the
bailiff had the best chance of
recovering their money.","It was unclear what ordering the
defendant to court would
achieve.",
13,Choose method,enforcement-selection,choose-method,,"28 - seems like a long way around, he may be lying. If I knew his address I'd drive past to see what he owed. 30 - quite clear, it says it there. 30.22 - bailiffs. it puts an end to it. Prices are high but i've run out of patience. Reasonably confident as I believe they have the money.",31.00 this is where i might change my mind - depends on cost. bailiff option - only one it doesn't specify costs,,"The bailiff option should specify
costs.
● “This is where I might change my
mind...it depends on the cost.”",
14,Choose bailiff type,enforcement-selection,bailiffs,,"31.25 - I don't understand, less than 5000/at least 600? If I was 1800...not worded brilliantly. Put a range instead. 32.50 - basically HC is more expensive, CC cheaper. I'd go with CC as there's no cost if my amount was 600-5000. For 66 pounds though, getting back 6K is worth it. 36.50 - it's good that it's there but I didn't know it was there before because of the wording...should be 'what will a HC bailiff costs?', also want a list of recomended bailiffs. I noticed the link but thought it would just say 66 pounds. If I knew his situation I'd carry on.","32.00 are these fees real? ah it's only £77. [confused by less than / at least...] needs to reread it. maybe it should say 'if it's less than...' Am I being really stupid? i don't read things do I? high court bailiff 'is that TV programme thing' 34.40 in this scenario it would have to be option 2. Stephen would choose one himself, on basis of fees purely. 35.00 bloody hell [looking at hceo fees] 36.34 if you're asking for £6 grand they're not that bad [fees]","“Prices are high but I’ve run out of
patience...I am confident as I
believe Andrew Smith has the
money.”
● Participants felt that the fee was
fair as the amount of money
they were trying to get back was
significantly higher (£6,543.21).","It would make it clearer for
participants if the criteria was
presented as a range (£100-500
County Court, £600+ High Court)
● A list of recommended bailiffs
would be beneficial for
participants, if they wanted to do
their own research.",
15,Writ,writs,1,,"33.55 - That's good, but I know he doesn't fit any of this.",38.20 let's assuming i know andrew smith - but what does a court consider to be mental illness? how am I to know that? not privy to personal wellbeing. 39.00 how i am to know these things? having to guess!,"It’s useful that users are
reminded of these
considerations before they
continue, and it is reassuring to
know that their situation does not
match any of the options.","“What does the court consider to
be a mental illness? How am I to
know that? I’m not privy to his
personal wellbeing.”",
16,Before you apply 2,writs,2,,"34.30 - I find it weird that I have to name the bailiff. It should have to be earlier. This means more research. The bailiff must have a contract with the government, I'd not feel comfortable picking my own. 35.30 - good to repeat fee warning. 66 quid is worth the gamble. It's good to be reminded.",,"Participants liked that the fee was
repeated again, as “it’s good to be
reminded.”
● “66 quid is worth the gamble.”","“I find it weird that I have to name
the bailiff. It should be earlier.
This means more research.” -
Mentioning this option earlier
with a list of recommended
bailiff agencies would help
participants feel assured in their
decisions.",
17,Select HCEO,writs,select-hceo,application,Click choose for me,40.00 yes would want court to choose,"Participants wanted the court to
choose for them, as they didn’t
have the time to search for one.",,
18,Do you want the bailiff to collect the full debt,writs,5,application,"38:35 - Once i'm in, that high amount...I would not click no. 39:20 - I'd look for a mediation option if he doesn't have enough money...any payment plan option? No mediate option.",,"“Once I’m in...with that high
amount...I would not click no.” - As
the debt is so high and the
participants have got his far in the
process, they want the full
amount.","One participant expected a
mediation or payment plan
option.",
19,Address to visit,writs,7,application,Yes,,,,
20,Other contact details,writs,8,,Yes - 41 - I had these details. If I had more contact details I absolutely would enter.,40.40 add his email address- have all contact details on one page. space out phone number on page,"Participants would enter as many
contact details as they had for
the defendant (e-mail, other phone
numbers etc.)",,

I want a little dictionary at the side. 44.30 - when you go through this it's a process, you have to keep going back to check things and terms. 45:04 - this is clear and not confusing, car tax, passport etc. are not clear or clean. This is much more visually clear and the big writing means I don't have to put my glasses on. Modern. Looks good. 45.55 - now wait and see what's next, I'd check this everyday to see if he's paid. After 7 days I'd probably check again. 47 - Ah right...I did not realise, I have to click a button, I thought I had already done it. I'd expect the court to contact the bailiff directly. 48 - I needs to say, now click here to do it, on the last pagea.",42.35 oh it hasn't done it? thought I had done it.

he’s paid.”","Participants believed that the

bailiffs directly.”

wait 7 days.","One participant was still not clear
on what bailiff firm was being
used.",
,SUMMARY FEEDBACK,summary,,,"50:30 - Not as frightening as my own process as it's laid out clearly and you're not filling out paper forms (errors hard to change), I can edit choices. So much easier than my own process. 51.15 - the drop down menu explaining terms. Some kind of email would be very helpful if you get stuck. It would be really helpful, speaking to a human being (with anything, not just court). Put your mind at rest. A real necessity when you do things online. 53 - I'd like a call from the bailiff saying they've got the money. Even a text asking her to call. Help my worries. I don't know how the actual bailliff service works...so communication throughout would be good. ","47.10 name - bit long isn't it? sounds less serious - needs to be serious.  no i think it needs to be called 'court' something. 48.34 yeah fine in summary - quite simple (like HMRC) uncomplicated and clear. how it needs to be. everyone's different. 51.25 should't be put off eveyine should have a chance to get their money back. if you're on a low income - how you can claim.
