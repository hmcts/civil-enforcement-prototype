1,Writ e-mail ,Stay a writ,notification,email,"10.30 - Explaining what the HCEO will do, steps to potentially stop it, it's not a shock as you know that you owe money before this (not a nice message but what did you expect). 11.30 - What is the charge fee? You can therefore use this info to decide what to do. Weigh up costs and circumstances. 12.30 - what if I didn't want to stop it? view/stop should be separate. I'm in the wrong. 13.30 - Have to show evidence otherwise.",8.30 next steps - at least if i know they're coming i can put something in place and have something to negotiate on. 09.10 name of the claimant - could be any of my past clients. it's clear what's happening but not with who,,
2,Enter claim number,Stay a writ,security-layer,application,14.10 - for security/confidentiality. It's on the previous page maybe? Didn't notice. 14.35 - good if everything opens on a separate tab (email and access code input),,,
3,Enter your phone number,Stay a writ,security-layer,application,15.10 - for security. Not surprised as it is with the court.,,,
4,Access code ,Stay a writ,security-layer,application,"15.50 - same with a bank account, this code is only for me, another form of security","11.48 OTC in the moment, do it now. i don't want this to grow to extra charges. ",,
5,Defendant dashboard,Stay a writ,defendant-dashboard,dashboard,"16.20 - This is quite nice, as I had no clue when I got mine. Instead of panicking and googling it's all here, reassuring. Good there's the information. Payment plan option is good. 17.20 - you have different choices rather than looking externally. Clear options. 18.15 -  (expectations) Claim history is coresspondence, parties is claimant and defendant details, documents I assume evidence but they are two separate tabs so.... I like claim history...to see how long the time frame is and what's actually happening. Didn't know parties would include emails. I'd be skeptical of them having my address, and why would I need my address. 20.30 - people aren't always nice and friendly, leaves defendant vulnerable. 21 - Info must have come from the claimant. 22.15 - I'd expect uploaded evidence or coresspondence to be here...letters/statements etc. maybe link it to the claim history.",12.20 that timeline looks good - easy to read. better than a whole page of text. payment plans as soon as poss. it wouldn't make sense messing around. 14.10 if it said a different address you could dispute it. 15.04 docs - receipts from kate to show evidence. if i had multiple jobs (as def) i could put up my evidence as well. 16.42 if you want to pay but can't now - would prob go to the first one. ,,
8,Hearing type,Stay a writ,stay-writ,application,"23.20 - remote is good, going to court is serious (but situation isn't always), suggests it being relax. What happens after 'i don't want a hearing', not sure why you wouldn't...how would that affect the case? 24.50 - i'd click second due to relaxed nature of home. 25.05 - some things are trial and error, would click things and see if they apply otherwise will go back.",17.45 if i have to attend it's ok but video/telephone could do it withouth taking a morning off work and having to travel. not sure how that would work - skype??? option 3- i don't want a hearing - if i just want to pay it. ,,
9,Supporting evidence,Stay a writ,stay-writ,application,"26(earlier) - any documents I may have, correspondence. 26.05 - returning to my account. 26.50 - annoying if I'd gone far in the process or written a lot...and then cannot progress if I don't have a certain document. Want to save and return.",19.00 maybe you could put current jobs up there. [save and return?] if i closed it all? i shouldn't have to go back through the email etc the passcode - knows it's me/ i'd expect to log in from gov.uk 21.08 amount seems correct but no way i could pay that in one lump sum.,,
10,Check your answers,Stay a writ,stay-writ,application,"27.35 - confirmation, ability to change. Confidence? Not sure. Don't remember 55 payment at the beginning. Didn't summarise that, would be nice to have. Didn't state when the fee would come now, may not have my purse...need save and return. That's a lot for some people (55), it could be rejected.",21.30? there's a fee for the thing. each form has a fee.,,
11,Payment,Stay a writ,stay-writ,application,29.3,22.59 i'd expect to see all the card types there,,
12,Payment confirmation,Stay a writ,stay-writ,application,,25.14 it says 5-6 days. bailiffs may still come. yeah quite good - link to money mgmt website. ,,
13,Application submitted (dashboard),Stay a writ ,stay-writ,,"30 - This information needs be earlier, important to hear even if I didn't get to this stage. You always want to know how long something is going to be. E.g. bailiff coming in the 5 days, you would want to be there at this time - plan ahead. Expect contact after the 5 days. 32 - fair enough, important advice, especially with bailiff rights - lots of opinions rather than facts online. Return to dashboard - back to first page with application submitted.",,,
13.5,Claim form ,,documents,,,,,
14,Writ,Writ of control process,documents,,"33.50 - Explaining the whole process, the bailiffs come and take your goods. Nice to have a breakdown of what kinds of goods they will have. They have to be accountable for what they take. Good to have price breakdown. Digital or physical - paper probably (35.20) - anyone can make a documen online...but also print it off. Either way...digital makes more sense due to how technology is nowadays. As long as I can confirm the bailiff's identity.",26.25 it doesn't say pay by. can't see a phone number - anyone's at this point! def not the claimants! agents - various ones- you can't see who they all are. 28.00 call someone or do something -should say. at this point i have no gov.uk account - all on paper? we've gone beyond calls now [by this stage]! ,,
15,Covering letter,Writ of control process,documents,,"36.30 - is this new? Verify court order is very important - more important than bailiff's identity. Gives you reassurance. Expect to go to GOV website and enter a reference number. All good to have advice there, information you would want. ",29.30 i'd have to go on this website quickly while they're standing there. they can't go back and tell kate nothing! i'd have to leave them on the doorstep and go and check.,,
16,Verify writ,Writ validation,check-writ,application,"38.40 - claim number is on the writ I assume but I didn't spot it, (39.25) would be nice to be higher",31.25 i thought that's good - i'd go on there and check. i reckon it's going to be simple - a postcode checker or something. claim number would be on the letter or the writ,,
17,Input writ details,Writ validation,check-writ,application,,,,
18,Writ validation confirmation,Writ validation,check-writ,application,"39.50 - it's good that you can download a copy, in case the bailiff  has amended it. I'd check it on my phone, don't mind checking it in front of them. You have to let bailiffs in anyway.",32.42 it's going to show a copy of it [like we saw earlier] ,,
,SUMMARY FEEDBACK,,summary,,"41 - RUMC name? I like it, not as technical. Precise. Civil enforcement sounds like police. Resolve gives you a bit of hope. 42 - I like it. Everything is right there for you, precise. Cuts out lots of paperwork. Have to go to solicitor with paperwork in my case. I can just download and e-mail. Never sure about legitimacy, so having it all there is great. 43.15 - Can do it without a solicitor. It's all broken down for you, with links for extra help, all the options are there for you. 43.45 - wording of email - 'click to view claim details AND stop a writ' - maybe two different boxes. 44.20 - when will it be released? ","34.35 info on DB - it's good having both names, it's enough. 35.20 - name - sounds ok. solve claims before the charges are added. better to have people on a payment plan than nothing and fees growing. sounds good. 36.20 'it just seems so easy, you could probably do it on your own' ",,
